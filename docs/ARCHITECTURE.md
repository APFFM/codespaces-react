# Application Architecture

This document outlines the architectural decisions and organization of the codebase to help new contributors understand how the application is structured.

## Directory Structure

```
/src
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
├── context/          # React context providers
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── services/         # API and external service integrations
├── styles/           # CSS and styling files
├── utils/            # Helper functions and utilities
├── pages/            # Page components that represent routes
└── assets/           # Static assets like images
```

## Component Organization

We follow a component-driven architecture with these guidelines:

1. **Atomic Design Principles**: Components are organized following atomic design methodology where appropriate:
   - Atoms (basic building blocks)
   - Molecules (groups of atoms)
   - Organisms (groups of molecules)
   - Templates (page layouts)
   - Pages (specific instances of templates)

2. **Component Responsibilities**:
   - Components should be focused on a single responsibility
   - Container components manage state and data flow
   - Presentation components focus on rendering UI

3. **State Management**:
   - Local component state for UI-specific state
   - Context API for shared state across component trees
   - Considering more advanced state management for complex state logic

## Data Flow

Data flows in a unidirectional pattern:
1. Props are passed down from parent to child components
2. Events and actions propagate up through callbacks
3. Context provides state to components across the tree without prop drilling

## Naming Conventions

- Components use PascalCase (e.g., `SudokuGame.jsx`)
- Non-component files use camelCase (e.g., `aiService.js`)
- CSS modules use kebab-case (e.g., `sudoku-game.module.css`)
- Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HINTS`)

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utility functions and smaller components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Performance Considerations

- Memoization of expensive calculations with useMemo
- Prevention of unnecessary re-renders with React.memo and useCallback
- Code splitting for lazy loading components when appropriate
- Optimizing assets and bundle size
